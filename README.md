# PHP Blog

This is a simple blog application written in PHP. It is intended to be used as a learning tool for PHP and MySQL. I have developed this application as a part of my internship at [NetAdÄ±m](https://www.netadim.com/). And I am sharing this project with you to help you learn PHP and MySQL.

## Running the project

This project uses Docker Compose for both development and production environment. Following command will start a MySQL server and a PHP server where you can see the changes as you update the code.

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```
